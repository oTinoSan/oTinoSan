My name is Santino S. Currently I'm a junior student at Fayetteville State University's Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program. Outside of classes, I participate as a full-time Undergraduate Researcher in the Intelligent Systems Lab [(ISL)](https://www.uncfsu.edu/academics/colleges-schools-and-departments/lloyd-college-of-health-science-and-technology/department-of-mathematics-and-computer-science/intelligent-systems-laboratory) .
