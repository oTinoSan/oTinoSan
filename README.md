# Hi there üëã

## ü•∏ Who I am...
Hi, I'm [Santino S](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santino-sini-53450811b/). Currently I'm a junior in Fayetteville State University's Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program. Outside of class, I participate as a full-time Undergraduate Researcher in the Intelligent Systems Lab [(ISL)](https://www.uncfsu.edu/academics/colleges-schools-and-departments/lloyd-college-of-health-science-and-technology/department-of-mathematics-and-computer-science/intelligent-systems-laboratory). I completed a summer 2023 software internship with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's [EELS](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/robotics-at-jpl/eels). I am looking for a summer 2024 internship that will be equally challenging and motivating. Some topics I've especially enjoyed learning about recently are networking, python/c++ code, and robotics.

## ü¶æ What I'm currently working on...
As a part of ISL, I am attached to two projects, Efficient Edge AI for Robotics and Earth Observation (IMPACT) and Object Detection and Mapping between Vantage Points of Multi-Robot System (AOMRP). Both projects are AI focused with goals on automating surveillance and detection of objects of interest within multi-robot systems including drones and rovers.

## ‚ùì Ask me about...
Anything! But especially links or explainations of my current work.

## üìñ Fun fact...
I love writing and literature. Along with my traditional fiction aspirations, I am very interested in contributing to the field of electronic literature.
